							<a href="http://glutsandgluttony.com" target="_blank" class="u-c--brand"
								>www.glutsandgluttony.com</a

							you a little more about who she is, and why she’s so in love with
							AEG.

						Even if you really enjoy your job, there’s always that little voice
						telling you to just give it all up and move to the countryside.
						Escape the stress and build a career around your hobby or your
						passion.
					</p>
					<p>
						Kathy was one of the few brave enough to take that step to walk away
						from her career: “When I quit, moved to the countryside and started
						growing my own food, my obsession hit new heights and it seemed like
						a really natural thing for me to make my slightly obsessive hobby a
						job.”
					</p>

					<p>
						For many people who love food and love cooking, it often starts from
						a young age. Being around the kitchen as a child, or having a mum or
						dad who helps you understand more about food rather than throwing
						turkey dinosaurs on a plate with chips, will set you in good stead.
						Kathy’s experiences are very similar:
					</p>
					<p>
						“I’ve always been greedy. My parents are keen cooks and I’d grown up
						eating anything and everything and being shown that food is
						exciting, creative and sociable.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Kathy believes there’s a simple joy in growing your own veg patch:
					</p>
					<blockquote class="article-quote">
						<p>
							There’s something magical about growing your own food and cooking
							it.
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						And there’s nothing better than seeing the results of your work:
						“It’s incredible to think that you put a tiny seed in the ground,
						nurture it and before long you’ve got kilos of, say, tomatoes to
						make an incredible salad with.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Her passion is matched by a flair for good food, which led to Kathy
						becoming a private chef for hire, as well as a cooking tutor. Her
						talent shines through on her blog, where she posts tips on growing
						all kinds of vegetables, and shares some amazing recipes.
					</p>
					<p>
						Her favourite? “I’m a huge fan of slightly whimsical desserts so I’m
						really pleased with my rhubarb, orange blossom and marzipan
						strudel.” But it’s the gluts – the huge amount of veg that Kathy
						grows at once – that inspired the blog. “I always plant too much.
						I’m hopeless at restraint.”
					</p>

					<p>
						Hopeless at restraint she may be, but it’s her level-headed attitude
						and genuine personality which shine through her blog, and in her
						view it’s important to relax when it comes to cooking:
					</p>
					<blockquote class="article-quote">
						<p>
							Don’t be afraid! The worst that could happen is that something
							doesn’t work – which is not the end of the world! Also, lots of
							chefs make a big deal about how difficult it is and how skilled
							you have to be to cook, which is rubbish.
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						One thing she does think is a big deal is the quality of your oven.
						“There’s nothing more annoying than an oven that doesn’t heat up
						enough or has hot spots which burn bits of your dish whilst others
						remain stubbornly undercooked.”
					</p>

					/>
					<p>
						Her skill as a cook led to a working partnership with AEG. She used
						their appliances at a cookery school before starting the website,
						and she was later invited to continue partnering with them for
						festivals and demonstrations. It’s clear that she values working
						with AEG ovens when she cooks:
					</p>
					<p>
						“What’s great about the AEG ovens across the board is that they are
						so intuitive to use. You don’t need a manual in your hand all the
						time! Plus, the results are consistently good because they are so
						well made: you always get an even bake, they are always at the
						temperature they say they are – a good solid piece of kit.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Kathy is clear that a good oven is the key to good food. You don’t
						need to be a trained chef to start following in her footsteps, and
						her website is a great place to start. Make sure you take a look and
						find out more about growing your own veg and how to best use it. If
						you love cooking, or it’s something you want to do more of, then
						it’s also worth thinking about an upgrade to your oven.
					</p>
					<p>
						Whether you’re a have-a-go home cook or someone with ambitions to
						follow in Kathy’s footsteps, an AEG oven will help you to deliver
						exceptional results.
